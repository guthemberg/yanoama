bootstrap scripts:
	* bootstrap.sh: 
	main bootstrap script. It must be called 
	whenever we need to deploy our system to 
	a testbed node. it calls install_role.py 
	script.
	
	* install_role.py: 
	it verifies if this node will pay either a 
	coordinator or a peer role in a CDN 
	infrastructure. if defines the node role 
	according to the main configuration file
	(yanoama.conf). Regarding to the node role,
	it installs scripts to the local system as 
	cron jobs. for coordinators it installs:
	monitoring/get_rtt.py and peering.py. for
	peers, it installs membership.py. 
	

scripts for specific role:
	* coordinator:
		+ peering.py: this script must run 
		periodically, twice a day (as a cron
		job). it allows coordinators to exchange
		the list of peers and define membership
		lists based on latency.

	* peer:
		+ membership.py: is a script to be run
		periodically (e.g. as a cron job, 
		once a day frequency). It allows peers 
		to connect to a coordinator and check 
		membership.it creates /etc/hosts file 
		with a 'coordinator' entry according 
		to the peer membership. peers without 
		this entry are not allowed to 
		participate to the CDN.

miscelanous:
	* view_available_nodes_warapper.sh: 
	this scripts permits reading the raw 
	information for membership. basically, it
	prints out a ordered list of testbed nodes
	based on latency
	*get_conf_info: return information from conf files (e.g. to get db port, run
	python get_conf_info.py db_port)
